# About this project

**Gapminder Data Analyzer** is a desktop **Java** application that used Gapminder data (http://www.gapminder.org) from a **MySQL** database, to show comparative charts between different metrics and countries, between specific time periods.

The application used the **D3/C3** Javascript charting libraries, running in **Webviews**.

# More details
* The folder 'Database Backup' contains a dump of all the database tables.
* The Gapminder folder contains both the raw downloaded data and the Unpivoted ones.
* To use it with your own database, change the hard-coded connection data in the Model/DatabaseHandler class.
